### Setting up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use `pipenv` to create and manage a virtual environment for your project. Follow these steps to set up a virtual environment:

1. Install `pipenv` if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   pip install pipenv
   ```
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashaskhot/FinjanGo.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd expenseswebsite/
   ```

4. Create a virtual environment and install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

### Installing Project Dependencies

After setting up the virtual environment, you can install project dependencies:

```bash
pipenv install
```

### Running Migrations

Perform initial database migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
